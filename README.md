## Source Material

- [Whitepaper (2023)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/external-server-authorization-with-lambdaedge/)
- [Lambda@Edge developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-examples.html) 
- [AWS samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/cloudfront-authorization-at-edge)

## Major Goals
- Secure CloudFront content distribution using external server Authz.
- Dockerize the Lambda@Edge function and the Authz server.
- Translate the working local config to Terraform HCL.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ .localstack
â”œâ”€â”€ authz
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”œâ”€â”€ lambda
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform
â””â”€â”€ tools
```

- **.localstack**: Config and volumes for [localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/lambda/)
- **authz**: A simple golang webserver with which to iterate on requests and responses.
- **docs**: Documentation about this project.
- **lambda**: Typescript code for the Edge Lambda function described in the [Whitepaper](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/external-server-authorization-with-lambdaedge/).
- **terraform**: Terraform HCL configuration files to provision AWS resources.
- **tools**: Scripts and helpers for the above.

## Plan of Attack

### [ðŸ”¥] 1. Build the Lambda@Edge Function and the Authz server 
- [ðŸ”¥] Build the Typescript Lambda@Edge function that forwards requests to an external server for authorization.
- [ðŸ”¥] Create an S3 bucket whose contents we want to protect.
- [ðŸ”¥] Write a simple, surrogate Authz server to build out behavior.
- [ðŸ”¥] Bonus points for localhost encryption of data in transit.

### [ðŸ”¥] 2. Build the Docker images
- [ðŸ”¥] Package the Lambda@Edge function into a Docker container, using the AWS runtime image.
- [ðŸ”¥] Build the Authz Docker image.
- [ðŸ”¥] Run the Lambda container in localstack and ensure it communicates with Authz.
- [ðŸ’§] Edge Lambda restriction: it cannot run Docker images, we must rely on zip packages.

### [ðŸ”¥] 3. Local Iteration
- [ðŸ”¥] Add a file to the localstack S3 bucket, ensure it's unprotected.
- [ðŸ”¥] Front the localstack S3 bucket with localstack's CloudFront.
- [ðŸ”¥] Ensure the file remains accessible.
- [ðŸ”¥] Iterate on the Lambda@Edge function and Authz server until we can toggle between protected and unprotected states.
- [ðŸ’§] While localstack is excellent and a valuable tool, for our immediate purposes [edgelambde is not yet implemented](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/5483).

### [ðŸ”¥] 4. AWS Deployment / POC
- [ðŸ”¥] Translate the localstack configs to their big-brother AWS representations with Terraform HCL.
- [ðŸ”¥] Create a temporary S3 bucket, so we don't leak anything during initial setup.
- [ðŸ”¥] Upload the gif to the bucket.
- [ðŸ”¥] Front the S3 bucket with a CloudFront distribution.
- [ðŸ”¥] Deploy the Lambda@Edge function.
- [ðŸ”¥] Deploy the surrogate Authz server.
- [ðŸ”¥] Ensure the gif is protected by the Lambda@Edge function.

### 5. AWS Deployment / The Real Deal
- Modify the Lambda@Edge function to use the real Authz server.
- Ensure the gif is protected by the Lambda@Edge function.
- Modify the install to use the real S3 bucket and CloudFront distributions.
- Ensure the real content is protected by the Lambda@Edge function.
